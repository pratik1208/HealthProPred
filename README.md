# HealthProSpec
**Problem Statement:**
Distinguishing between healthcare professionals and the general public is pivotal for targeted engagement and communication in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, knowing an HCP's precise specialization is essential for providing tailored and relevant information. However, accurately identifying these attributes can be challenging due to the diverse nature of users and the volume of available data. HealthProSpec aims to create a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting HCP status and their respective medical specializations based on user data.
**Solution Overview:**
HealthProSpec employs a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms and feature engineering to analyze user data and infer their professional status and specialization. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising user attributes, behavioral patterns, and relevant domain-specific features. This comprehensive approach ensures the model's ability to generalize well and make accurate predictions on new data.
